# Welcome to mdbase

**Your new superpower for distraction-free writing.** 🚀

---

**mdbase** is a clean canvas for your thoughts, powered by the web's most versatile format: **Markdown**. I built this tool because I wanted a better, more streamlined way to craft and preview READMEs for GitHub. Whether you're documenting code, drafting a novel, or perfecting your profile, **mdbase** provides the focus you need to write with clarity.

## 🎨 Formatting Playground

Don't just write - *express* yourself.

- **Bold** ideas stand out.
- *Italic* nuances matter.
- ~~Bad ideas~~ can be struck through.
- `Code snippets` look right at home.

### Lists & Tasks

Stay organized with ease:

1.  Prioritize your goals.
2.  Break them down.
3.  Execute.

- [x] Launch mdbase
- [ ] Be amazed
- [ ] Write the next best-seller using:
    - [x] Nested lists
    - [ ] Focus mode

## ⚡ Power Features

We support **GitHub Flavored Markdown** and more!

- **Tables** for structured data.
- **Blockquotes** for impactful citations.
- **Footnotes** for extra context.

## 🔮 Upcoming Features

- **Mermaid diagrams** for visual storytelling.

### 💻 Syntax Highlighting

```javascript
const writeCode = (lines) => {
  console.log(`Writing ${lines} lines of code...`);
  return "Done!";
};
```



> [!TIP]
> **Pro Tip:** You can split the view (⌘ + J) to see the raw Markdown alongside your preview/editor!
